# Formik Multi-Step Form with Yup Validation

This is for a multi-step form built with Formik, Yup, TypeScript, and React.js. In this form, we will create three steps: Personal Information, Address Information, and Account Information.

This project demonstrates how to create a multi-step form in React using Formik for form management and Yup for form validation. The form is divided into three steps:

Personal Information: Collects personal details such as name, email, and phone number.
Address Information: Gathers address details like street address, city, and postal code.
Account Information: Asks for account-related information such as username and password.

## Features
1. Multi-step form with clear navigation between steps.
2. Form state management with Formik.
3. Real-time validation using Yup schema validation.
4. TypeScript for type checking and improved developer experience.
5. Error messages displayed for invalid inputs.
6. A simple and clean folder structure for easy maintenance.


## Folder Structure
The project has a structured folder layout to keep the code organized and maintainable:

src/
1. components/: Reusable React components.
2. containers/: High-level components that manage the form's state and logic.
3. App.tsx: The main application component.
4. index.tsx: Entry point of the application.
5. public/: Static assets and HTML template.
